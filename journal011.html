        <b>JOURNAL #011</b><br><br>

        Well after looking for hours I ate my own words, there IS actually somebody in here, the only life i<br> could ever find in this abandoned planet, she is a gorgeous gray lady with large horns, red make up<br> and with some kind of kimono on, she is meditating in... a pretty peculiar way, and she didn’t look<br> like she was gonna answer me any moment.<br><br>

        The TV led me to her, it seems this can act like a metal detector. And by then I thought the TV was<br> from her since it was brighter when i got closer, but  seeing her lack of interest in anything else<br> kinda made it clear that she wasn’t the reason.<br><br>

        There was a note close to her though and it said that I could own the building that is below her.<br> That’s the nicest thing anyone has ever done to me!<br><br>

        The first person I've ever met and I already make a friend! I wish there was some more interaction<br> than just a single note, like making jokes, talking about videogames, maybe dating? Is that how<br> people socialize? I have a memory that tells me that that’s just how you start a relationship, but the<br> other memory just tells me that if you like somebody you should put a ring on it and never question<br> it. At this point I just don’t listen to those memories so whatever.<br><br>

        Now I have a whole building of my own where I can keep doing my working stuff! It feels like it was<br> 10 years ago since I regain my consciousness, and now I have a home. Now I know that it was this<br> place the reason why the TV was shining so much, so now I am off to make a tour through all my<br> new house.<br><br>

        Hopefully this leads me to something good.<br><br>
    </p>
