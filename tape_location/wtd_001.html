        A tragedy happened today.<br><br>


        After days of looking for an island, you finally found the right one, it was all thanks to that lusus you<br> were following, but sadly,<br><br>

        <img src="https://file.garden/Xpo1ZV1bbgcDmDaE/ANNIVERSARY%20BANNERS/YEAR%203/ARCHIVES/WTD%20TAPES/A%20FISH%20CRIES/002.png" width="650" height="450"><br><br>

        he died afterwards with his grub.<br>


        You don’t know what could’ve happened for them to die like this, it makes you feel weird, you don’t<br> remember this feeling at all, your eyes are wet, your lip is trembling, is this sadness?<br><br>

        <img src="https://file.garden/Xpo1ZV1bbgcDmDaE/ANNIVERSARY%20BANNERS/YEAR%203/ARCHIVES/WTD%20TAPES/A%20FISH%20CRIES/003.png" width="650" height="450"><br><br>

        You kneel down towards the dead lusus that helped you and his grub, and cry your tears out, you don’t<br> like this feeling at all, but somehow you manage to accept it.<br><br>


        Days ago, you had to say goodbye forever to a dear friend of yours, the dead grub reminds you of him<br> somehow, it reminds you on how you are probably never going to see him again…<br><br>


        You cry.<br><br>

        A bubble appears, it touches the dead grub's head.<br><br><br><br>



        You hear whimpering. <br><br><br><br>
