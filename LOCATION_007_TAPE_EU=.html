            Once upon a time there was an old woman who lived in the middle of the jungle inhabited by nobody<br> but her and her husband<br><br>

            She was a really famous archeologist, known by all the adventures written about her 1000 trips she did<br> throughout her life.<br><br>

            However, she never wanted any of that popularity, leading her and her husband to isolate from society<br> in the jungle for their own good<br><br>

            Life surrounded by what she investigated was good, and with the company of her husband it was just<br> the perfect life.<br><br>

            No problems at all, but what they didn’t know is that that perfect life was going to change for the both<br> of them forever<br><br><br><br>

            Today was a very special night for the both of them, it was the day when she proposed to her husband,<br><br>

            right in this place, at this hour, and it felt like the stars were at the same place as they always were.<br><br>

            However,...<br><br>

            <img src="https://file.garden/Xpo1ZV1bbgcDmDaE/ANNIVERSARY%20BANNERS/YEAR%203/ARCHIVES/TAPEQUEST/THE%20OLD%20MAN%20AND%20THE%20STAR%20(B-SIDE)/004.png" width="650" height="450"><br><br>

            A giant meteor crashed down the forest!!!<br><br>

            <img src="https://file.garden/Xpo1ZV1bbgcDmDaE/ANNIVERSARY%20BANNERS/YEAR%203/ARCHIVES/TAPEQUEST/THE%20OLD%20MAN%20AND%20THE%20STAR%20(B-SIDE)/005.png" width="650" height="450"><br><br>

            They went as fast as they could towards the place it landed. Nothing that strange has ever happened to<br> them before, and it could be a great opportunity for them in the name of archeology, but as soon as<br> they got there, they found the unexpected.<br><br>

            A baby was in the meteor<br><br>

            <img src="https://file.garden/Xpo1ZV1bbgcDmDaE/ANNIVERSARY%20BANNERS/YEAR%203/ARCHIVES/TAPEQUEST/THE%20OLD%20MAN%20AND%20THE%20STAR%20(B-SIDE)/007.png" width="650" height="450"><br><br>

            As strange as it was, the old woman couldn’t help but feel some sort of joy by the baby. She always<br> wanted to have a baby that she could take care of and extend the Starker family legacy. You never could<br> take the first step out of fear of your husband rejecting the idea, but when you saw the baby, you<br> couldn't help but see how happy the 3 of you would be together, you even thought of the name already<br> "Mark Starker" the meteor boy. <br><br>However.<br><br>

            <img src="https://file.garden/Xpo1ZV1bbgcDmDaE/ANNIVERSARY%20BANNERS/YEAR%203/ARCHIVES/TAPEQUEST/THE%20OLD%20MAN%20AND%20THE%20STAR%20(B-SIDE)/008.png" width="650" height="450"><br><br>

            Her husband grabbed her, he could see the joy in her eyes, but he knew that sooner or later that joy<br> would die forever. The old woman not understanding why he was taking her away from the meteor<br> baby, started screaming in panic and struggling to get out of there. He couldn’t let her take the baby, for<br> that baby was destined to die at some point.<br><br>

            The old woman stopped moving, she cried.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

            A mysterious figure is seen on the distance, with eyes of shame, for leaving the meteor baby behind<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

            The next day, the husband went back to the meteor hole, he was going to get rid of all the evidence of<br> what happened last day, even lying to his wife making her think that all that happened that day was just<br> a fever dream. However, when he got into the hole, nothing but a giant white screen was in there.<br><br>

            …<br><br>

            He never was the same after that unfortunate day<br><br><br><br>
