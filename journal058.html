        New comrades, another feature, yadda yadda.<br><br>

        That doesn’t matter right now. Today my assistant gave me a VHS tape with the title OMEGA<br> on the cover (Thanks to her I discovered the TV accepted Tapes), <br> and when I inserted it in the TV it showcased something <br> weirder than the typical gray creatures. This character was an actual human being<br> his name was JOEL and his story was breathtaking, <br> because it was the most boring story I've ever seen in my whole miserable life, most of the time the kid was<br> just looking at his secret base chest and that’s fucking it, My assistant told me that that wasn't what she saw <br> but I just didn't give a shit, however I forgot to take off the cord and<br> because of my foolery a new room showed up, but this one was peculiar...<br><br>

        This room had two big windows separated between two different colored rooms, green and red, I tried to look closely<br> to the window in the green side but as soon as I got there, a kid comes out and breaks down the screen<br><br>

        We were launched against the wall and once the kid opens his eyes he asked where he was,<br> apparently this room wasn’t his at all and that was pretty weird considering most of the comrades knew<br> where they were. He quickly ignored that and procceed to ask me about a certain 2nd tape, no clue<br> what he was talking about and after knowing the truth he stops for a moment and starts crying.<br> He stood up from the floor and went from where he came, leaving a tape on the floor as he was slowly approaching the window.<br><br>

        I took the tape for as soon as he left, I got a feeling that investigating this will be really important for me, <br> as this may be the answer of everything, However as soon as I left<br> the room, another window was crashed down. I looked back at the room and find out the window of the <br> red side broken, however there was nobody left behind the broken window<br> except some dark goo on the floor.<br><br>
