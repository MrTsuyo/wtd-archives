        New comrades, another feature, yadda yadda.<br><br>

        That doesn’t matter. After my assistant gave me a tape and so I discovered that the TV accepts tapes, I <br>finally saw something out of the place that isn’t a gray creature. This character was a human being<br> instead, his name was JOEL and he has the most boring story I've ever seen, most of the time he was<br> looking at his secret base chest and that’s fucking it, however I forgot to take off the cord and<br> because of my foolery a new room showed up, however this one was peculiar...<br><br>

        This room had two big windows separated between two different colours, I tried to look closely<br> to the window in the green side but as soon as I got there a fucking kid yeet’d out of the window<br> towards me.<br><br>

        We slammed against the floor and as soon as the kid opened his eyes he asked where he was,<br> apparently this room wasn’t his and that was pretty weird considering most of the comrades knew<br> where they were, he quickly ignored that and procceed to ask me about a certain 2nd tape, no clue<br> what he was talking about and once he knew the truth he left a tape in the ground and went back to<br> the window with.<br><br>

        I took the tape for investigations as this may be the answer of everything, However as soon as I left<br> the room I heard another window crashing. The window of the red side was broken and some dark<br> goo was left behind it.<br><br>
