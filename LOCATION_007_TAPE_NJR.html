            Once upon a time…<br><br><br><br>

            <img src="https://file.garden/Xpo1ZV1bbgcDmDaE/ANNIVERSARY%20BANNERS/YEAR%203/ARCHIVES/WTD%20TAPES/THE%20PRINCESS%20AND%20THE%20SPACE%20PIRATE/002.png" width="650" height="450"><br><br>

            There was a princess<br><br>

            Who fell in love with a Space Pirate<br><br>

            And they both agreed they were meant to be together.<br><br>

            Even if the world told them, it was an impossible love<br><br><br><br>

            <img src="https://file.garden/Xpo1ZV1bbgcDmDaE/ANNIVERSARY%20BANNERS/YEAR%203/ARCHIVES/WTD%20TAPES/THE%20PRINCESS%20AND%20THE%20SPACE%20PIRATE/003.png" width="650" height="450"><br><br>

            But the pirate had a plan, to get a treasure from a faraway land<br><br>

            That will bond their love for the rest of their lives.<br><br><br><br>

            At the end of the season, the pirate's quest was successful<br><br>

            But the pirate wasn’t himself anymore<br><br>



            Saying that she had a power in her tears that he sought<br><br><br><br>

            The pirate trapped the princess, she was a princess no more<br><br>

            Surrounded by a thousand bubbles that she cried everyday<br><br><br><br>

            But her magic within her tears wasn’t good enough<br><br>

            Filled with anger from his broken promise of bonding love,<br><br>

            Instead transformed him into a monster… <br><br><br><br>
