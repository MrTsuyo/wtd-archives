        <b>JOURNAL #008</b><br><br>

        After walking through pure nothingness and studying the TV I finally found a place to stay.<br><br>

        It was a huge green planet covered all over with yellow leaves and giant white branches, it even had<br> a pink moon as a company but it sure had a weird rotation through its orbit. I am not one to discuss<br> astronomy and besides that doesn’t matter because I had to check if there was any kind of life in it.<br><br>

        I took a look at the branches and all of its leaves were dying one by one, it makes me wonder how<br> much time has this plant stayed alive. Everything was covered in yellow leaves and since I have an<br> artistic point of view this needs to be painted and put in a museum, its beauty is unimaginable,<br> however I’ve noticed how incredibly quiet this place is even though its all filled with cities.<br><br>

        There were buildings, vehicles, stations and even highways, but no cheese mac, this whole planet is<br> empty. I don’t know if  these yellow leaves have anything to do with the absence of people, but that<br> sure sounds like an incredibly stupid excuse of extinction, unless all of these buildings were made by<br> one single person just to make it more awesome looking, that’s even stupider and egocentric.<br><br>

        However one thing that I've noticed is that the TV was shining a little bit, that has to mean that its<br> related with this planet. Anyways I am off to search even further but I am not positive of finding<br> anything new than just nothing.<br><br>

        Hopefully I will finally get some answers at last.<br><br>
