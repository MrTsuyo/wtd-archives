        <b>JOURNAL #032</b><br><br>

        Today has been a really weird fucking day.<br><br>

        After watching different points of view of gray beings doing some weird shit I came to the conclusion<br> that these creatures are somehow important. So in my research of trying to find out a way to<br> expand this signal to its max I discovered something really important about myself, I was legitimately<br> capable of creating mass AND manipulate it to turn it in the object I was thinking, and, it’s so crazy i<br> don’t even know if I should even write this down???<br><br>

        What happened is that while I was revising the TV, I saw that there was a plug socket hidden in the<br> back of the TV, and like that was the bees knees because if there was a way of making it work better,<br> then I had to do something about it right now. However as soon as I got excited I quickly was<br> punched by reality, there were many plugs to connect it around the room but sadly I didn’t have any<br> wire cords to use, and in a moment of frustration, out of my hand, a motherfucking chord that i<br> could extend at my own will comes out!!!<br><br>

        I was so amazed by this that I couldn’t help but shake my hands like a small kid, however that wasn’t<br> the weirdest thing that happened today.<br><br>

        In my chance of trying to connect the TV to see if the signal was better I was completely face<br> slammed by the same amount of TV white noise as always.<br><br>

        TV was barely showing the crazy adventures of an anxious coffee drinking girl, nothing of interest at<br> the moment as i was worrying about more important things, BUT THEN the cable started doing<br> some weird shit, it was like it was sending strange signals at the end of the plug for at least a full<br> minute, and when it stopped the room next to me started to glow with a pink light<br><br>

        I carefully opened the door and what I saw in there left my whole brain out of control.<br><br>

        The living room was completely changed to an elegant pink room with light bulbs covering the<br> ceiling and coffee cups all over the floor. One thing I was sure of was that this was someone's room<br> and that it was certainly not here before. There I met the weirdest person I could ever meet.<br><br>

        The owner of the room was a cat girl whose name was never given to me, and she received me in<br> the most shitty way possible just by saying "Who the fuck are you?" I tried to analyze the situation<br> and explain her everything I was doing. Fortunately she chug the information with no problems,<br> she even offered to help me with my goal, however she clearly told me “give me shit to do as many<br> times as possible“, and like... I didn’t know how to react to that so I just kinda ignored it.<br><br>

        And that’s the weird story on how I learned the words shit and fuck. Now I am off to do some tests<br> with this portal wire cord.<br><br>
