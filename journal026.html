        <b>JOURNAL #026</b><br><br>

        Weeks has passed since I moved to this place, it’s incredible how this whole building is not fully<br> explored yet. The first room I found was the office, it was pretty big and green, a little bit destroyed<br> though, it looked like if there was a fight in here between a kid and a grown ass man, and the man<br> was the one who started the fight. It was fixed eventually thanks to my new assistant, she is pretty<br> hard working I am glad I found her and rescued from her flippin’ jam like prison (It literally looked like<br> a flask of jam), glad to have some nice company that isn’t meditating with a block on her head.<br><br>

        Going back to the main topic, I’ve finally fixed all the awful wounds the TV had! And also gave it<br> some nice looking green painting and a keyboard set as an extra, however the hard part is yet to<br> come, I need to find a way to internally fix this thing to make it fully work, “fully” because it halfly<br> works.<br><br>

        When i tried to turn it on the signal was just awful, it was just white noise all over, but I could see<br> something popping out of the screen after adjusting the channel, something unusual...<br><br>

        In the other side of the TV there was a young gray kid holding a big book, bigger than his whole body<br> even! It was trying to make me give him a name, however something else showed up when I tried to<br> do that action, a strange looking white faceless creature came up out of nowhere and he was yelling<br> to a pink dude??? It was really weird but also interesting in a way. After trying to look more forward<br> into it I couldn’t hold the signal any longer and it just became white noise all over again.<br><br>

        However while I was checking it I discovered that the TV seems to only react whenever I try to lead its way forward<br> the scenario it is showing, but I don’t want it to just go that way, I need to discover a way of making<br> it fully work.<br><br>

        I will proceed to change the channel now.<br><br>
