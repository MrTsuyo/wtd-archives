        <b>JOURNAL #001</b><br><br>

        Voidness, emptiness, blankness.<br><br>

        Those were three of the first things I saw once I regained my consciousness, pure nothingness<br> covered in a beautiful blue cosmos of which a colossal red star kept him company, that was the next<br> thing I noticed, it was beautiful and warm, really warm, but I tried to ignore it to focus on what<br> happened before I lost my conscience.<br><br>

        I tried to remember anything that happened before waking up but I have mixed memories, like<br> being a kid that cutted himself with a shard, a green being that’s giving a ring to someone, a<br> shadowy figure that betrays an old man and...<br><br>

        I got the feeling none of those memories are from my property, but I still cannot understand why I<br> am sharing this twisted memories with different people. After wondering about my own existence, I<br> couldn't help but notice I showed up in the middle of a destroyed satellite, red fragments were<br> scattered around me like if I was the one who caused all this, maybe it is an explanation of why I am<br> here? I guess I'll never know.<br><br>

        Suddenly I noticed something that caught my attention, it was a broken gray television that was<br> wandering in this ocean of stars like me, it was covered in blood and it seemed as if someone had<br> been hit on the head with it, I couldn't help but be tempted to pick it up and try to fix it to see if it<br> got any answers for your existance.<br><br>

        And that’s when I found an objective for me.<br><br>
