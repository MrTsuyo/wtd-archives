        You are now AVLESI. And this…<br>

        is the end of everything.<br><br>



        You are back at your old cell, just looking at your stuff for the last time. Everything is destroyed due to the<br> recent events, it’s just a shame.<br><br>


        One of the things you find through the destroyed cell is a photo of you and Drolen when you were young and<br> you were still moirails. He was so happy back then, he used to have a pretty happy life, and all you did<br> about it was sour it with black coffee.<br><br>



        You are glad that at least you told him the truth, even if he isn’t taking it very well. Maybe your only<br> mistake was telling him right when everything was going to end, okay now you feel kinda shitty.<br><br>


        You look at the photo one more time, everything starts fading away from reality, you chuckle a bit and say <br>to yourself…<br><br>

        “You know, it’s funny, I am not even in th-”<br><br><br><br>

        You have a feeling that it's going to be a shitty night.<br><br><br><br>
