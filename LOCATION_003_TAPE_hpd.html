    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#971743;">
        DROLEN: 1t looks l1ke a TV<br>

        DROLEN: a really really old TV.
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#9cb635;">
        AVLESI: Oh, that olD thing.
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#971743;">
        DROLEN: You know what 1t 1s?
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#9cb635;">
        AVLESI: KinDa, it’s harD to explain. In fact I may be wrong because I found it like 500 sweeps ago.<br>
        AVLESI: Before you got stuck here, there was actually another one who also got stuck.<br>
        AVLESI: It was Yezhik and she seemeD to know some stuff about the minus plane, she tolD me everything she knew before she DisintegrateD.<br>
        AVLESI: Unlike you and I she coulDn’t survive the SMILE VIRUS, so now she is stuckeD in a constant loop of Death for all eternity.<br>
        AVLESI: Look there she is again, looping one more time.<br><br>
        AVLESI: Hi Yezhik!<br>
    </p>
    <p align="center" style="color:#3E3E05;">
        YEZHIK: AUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH!!!!!!
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#9cb635;">
        AVLESI: Heh, how ironic to Die by Disintegration, yet how saD. That’s a cursed power you can’t take off when the virus gets you, unlike you and I.
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#971743;">
        DROLEN: Can you answer my question already please?
    </p>
    <p align="center" style="color:#9cb635;">
        AVLESI: Oops sorry!<br>
        AVLESI: So, apparently that TV is like a way out of this plane, I think?<br>
        AVLESI: Or like, a gate between both existential planes?<br>
        AVLESI: I honestly Don’t know what she was saying, she was really stresseD while melting.
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#971743;">
        DROLEN: Then why don’t you use 1t to get out of here!?!?
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#9cb635;">
        AVLESI: You think I DiDn’t try it?<br>

        AVLESI: That thing is DeaD, I have trieD everything.<br>

        AVLESI: Adjusting the signal, jamming with the wheel things, even punching it on the head.<br>

        AVLESI: Believe me Drolen, I was also as frustrateD as you when I got here.<br>

        AVLESI: But it's just useless, just leave it there, and accept that we may never go back hive.<br>

        AVLESI: And besides! why would you want to leave the MINUS PLANE? Time and Space isn’t a thing here, we can just chill for all eternity.
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#971743;">
        DROLEN: Hmm…
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#9cb635;">
        AVLESI: Anyways I will call you back in 10 minutes.<br>

        AVLESI: Too-De-loo ~
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="color:#971743;">
        DROLEN: 1 told you to…!<br><br>
    </p>

    <p align="center">
        Avlesi hangs you up<br><br>

        <img src="https://file.garden/Xpo1ZV1bbgcDmDaE/ANNIVERSARY%20BANNERS/YEAR%203/ARCHIVES/WTD%20TAPES/IN%20MINUS%20PLANE/006.png" width="650" height="450"><br><br><br>

        You look at the TV for a bit. Nothing is seen on the pitch black screen, how sad.<br><br>

        Well not sad, you don't feel like that. What did he said about being frustrated? Are you feeling frustrated?<br><br>

        You think you are frustrated, you may never go back hive for all eternity, but, you don't feel anything<br><br>

        Why is it so hard to understand your own feelings, you barely understand anything about your own self<br><br>

        Not even your powers...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        You look at screen one more time, for some reason you can see something through that black screen.<br><br>


        You slowly get closer to it, a weird purple spark comes out of it
