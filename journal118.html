        <b>JOURNAL #118</b><br><br>
        Last page...<br>

        I have came to the conclusion, I have created a whole hell of my own.<br>

        Always trying to give this story the proper ending and failing, just to start over again.<br>

        Keeping this thing on was perhaps the worst idea ever.<br>

        And to think everything happened because of my selfish curiosity.<br>

        I am still waiting for the day i can give that kid the continuity he is looking for.<br>

        I don’t know how much time I have spent doing this or how much time I am gonna spend doing it.<br>

        But I am sure of one thing.<br>

        This story’s ending is uncertain.<br>

        This is the last time I am using this journal, it's not useful for me anymore.<br>

        It's just a waste.<br>

        However, If i ever find the way, I am convinced that I will just go back to you one last time.<br>

        But not now.<br>

        I already hear his steps...<br><br>

        <b>JOURNAL #119</b><br><br>
        Don’t forget this, me from the future.<br>

        Even if you don’t remember you wrote this<br>

        There is nothing impossible that can’t be done.<br>

        You have to find the way to do it even if it takes you forever<br>

        But there is always a way I assure you,<br>

        Remember this word for it will be the key of your problems.<br>

        Remember to...<br>

        CHEAT<br><br>
